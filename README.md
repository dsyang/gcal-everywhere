Gcal-Everywhere
===============


Gcal-Everywhere is a chrome extension that allows you to harness the power of google's natural language process to create calendar events with plain english sentences.

1) Select some text from any web page
2) Right-click, click on "add to google calendar"
3) Refine your selection (optional)
4) Create event!

Additionally, clicking on the Gcal-Everywhere button will bring up a traditional event dialog that allows you fine-grained control of your event.
